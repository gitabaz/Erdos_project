      "'BlackBerry\\'s are famed for their security — even President Obama uses one. But police in the Netherlands allege that they are able to intercept and decrypt emails sent on some PGP BlackBerry phones — a type of BlackBerry that comes with PGP encryption software pre-installed by third-party vendors. \"We are capable of obtaining encrypted data from BlackBerry PGP devices,\" a spokesperson for the Netherlands Forensic Institute (NFI) said to Motherboard. The police unit declined to provide any more information, saying that by doing so, \"we would provide criminals with exactly the information they would need in order to eventually get around our research method. We would like to prevent that and therefore have been very reserved with our explanation towards the press.\" Motherboard\\'s report was based on an earlier story from the Dutch site Crime News. The site apparently got hold of documents from the NFI, which say that the crack was able to open 279 of 325 encrypted emails it was tried on. Law enforcement apparently needs physical access to the phone for it to work. BlackBerry is telling news outlets that it needs more information about the alleged crack. \"We are confident that Blackberry provides the world\\'s most secure communications platform to government, military and enterprise customers,\" it said in a statement. \"However, we can\\'t comment on this claim as we don\\'t have any details on the specific device or the way that it was configured, managed or otherwise protected, nor do we have details on the nature of the communications that are claimed to have been decrypted.\" Tech news site The Register is speculating that the alleged crack is down to a problem with the third-party vendors. You can buy BlackBerrys with PGP pre-installed, and it might be that it was incorrectly installed — leading to an exploitable vulnerability. If that\\'s the case, then the third-party vendors have screwed up and BlackBerry isn\\'t to blame, and its core software hasn\\'t necessarily been compromised. Whatever the answer, Obama can probably breathe easy — he uses a custom BlackBerry with a host of secure features developed with the help of the NSA.'\n",

      "'Just in 2015, Swedish actress Alicia Vikander played a famous painter, a secret agent, and an artificial intelligence that wants to be human. It\\'s been quite a year for the 27-year-old, and it might all end with her receiving an Oscar for her nominated role in \"The Danish Girl.\" Playing artist Gerda Wegener in the film, Vikander gives a scene-stealing performance as the wife of fellow artist Lili Elbe (played by Eddie Redmayne), one of the first identifiable recipients of sex-reassignment surgery. But it\\'s just the latest in a stellar series of performances Vikander has done, which also includes the hit indie film \"Ex Machina.\" Let\\'s learn more about this star on the rise. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChevron icon\\nIt indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nChevron icon\\nIt indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options.\\n\\n \\n\\nVikander\\'s first taste of success came in 2007 with the Swedish soap opera \"Andra Avenyn\" (\"Second Avenue\"), which looked at the lives of a group of people living in the second-largest city in Sweden.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChevron icon\\nIt indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nChevron icon\\nIt indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options.\\n\\n \\n\\nIn 2009, she starred in her first feature film, \"Pure,\" in which she plays a troubled 20-year-old who, in leaving her family life, ends up in the arms of a married man.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChevron icon\\nIt indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nChevron icon\\nIt indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options.\\n\\n \\n\\nVikander then found notice in the US playing Kitty in the 2012 adaptation of the Tolstoy classic \"Anna Karenina,\" starring Keira Knightley in the lead role.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChevron icon\\nIt indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nChevron icon\\nIt indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options.\\n\\n \\n\\nThen earlier this year, audiences were wowed by Vikander\\'s portrayal of an artificial intelligence in \"Ex Machina.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChevron icon\\nIt indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nChevron icon\\nIt indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options.\\n\\n \\n\\nPlaying an AI named Ava, Vikander was covered head-to-toe in a silver mesh body suit that took hours to prepare for filming.

       "[\"Despite the difficulties they faced entering the job market during the worst recession in decades, millennials have found their way into the workplace, even teaching older generations a thing or two about new ways to work along the way. But, financially, it's been a rough decade or so for the youngest generation of workers. All generations were impacted by the Great Recession, but millennials may have had it the worst. They shouldered crushing student loan debt as they vied for a scarce spot in the labor market, only to find low pay and staggeringly long hours once they landed one. As a result, many millennials have delayed personal and financial milestones such as marriage and home ownership, and they're even staying at home with family longer than young people have in about 75 years. So, it's not difficult to understand why millennials may be feeling a little less than optimistic about their likelihood of getting ahead once they've finally caught up. And, sadly, they might be right. Let's take a look at a few obstacles facing millennials to try and understand their financial situation now and how it's likely to evolve in the years to come. Here are a few things to consider. 1. The middle class is shrinking and struggling financially. Millennials' new American dream of being able to move out of their parents' homes and achieve financial independence (and maybe even security someday) is pretty tough to envision, given the current state of the middle class. This economic group has been the majority in the U.S. for more than four decades, but now they are matched in size by the groups above and below them. Additionally, middle-class Americans have lower median income and lower median wealth than they did at the start of the new millennium. It's no wonder that millennials are concerned about the possibility of being able to achieve middle-class status, and being able to thrive if they do ever get there. 2. Millennials might be behind in terms of their job skills. Despite their abundance of education, American millennials' job skills don't measure up, according to research done by the Educational Testing Service. Millennials in the U.S. ranked 15 out of the 22 participating countries in literacy, came in last in numeracy (tied with Spain and Italy), and ranked last (alongside three other countries) in problem-solving in tech-rich environments. As the global economy expands, it becomes increasingly important that our young workers feel they can compete - and that's not exactly the case these days. Despite their best efforts to get a great education (and their willingness to absorb the accompanying debt) millennials, through no fault of their own, are struggling to keep up with workers around the world. 3. Student loan debt coupled with wage stagnation. Millennials are the most educated generation in history. Unfortunately, they also have more student loan debt than any previous generation. Although most graduates still feel their degrees were well worth the cost, there is no doubt there's a bit of a burden to bear here for young grads. On top of their debt, millennials (alongside the rest of the country) are dealing with wage stagnation despite an improving economy. Thus, getting ahead starts to feel like more and more of a pipe-dream. 4. It's hard to get ahead when you can't catch up. Entering the workforce during the worst economic downturn in decades had a big impact on millennials, and it's going to be hard for them to make up for lost time as they move forward. Their delayed entry into the housing market could be hurting the economy at large, and it might not be the best thing for millennials in the long-term, either. Their financial reality is marked by high unemployment rates, low savings, and low credit scores. Reversing these trends will take time. It's hard to think about getting ahead when you're still trying to catch up. And, that's exactly what a lot of millennials are focused on these days\",\n",
