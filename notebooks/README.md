# 2018 midterm election NLP analysis

This notebook contains results for exploratory data analysis (EDA) from the [components.one news dataset](https://components.one/datasets/all-the-news-2-news-articles-dataset/), random forest classifier, and topic modeling using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and latent semantic analysis (LSA). Analysis of the topic model is used to highlight important campaign strategies.

## Notes
To run just the LSA and NMF parts and not the whole notebook, the classified dataset (with those articles that contain politics somewhere in the section and those articles with no section that were classified as related to politics using a random forest classifier) can be found here:
