The next thing we wanted to do was decide which topics are the most important
for the political strategists as we approach the election month.

---

One of the metrics we've defined is the topic lifecycle which measures the
popularity of a particular issue relative to its annual peak value on a
month-to-month basis.

The values range from 0 to 1 where 1 corresponds to the maximum number of
articles for that topic and is a signal of when an important event has
occurred.

-----

Most topics are tied to events that occurred throughout 2018.

But we can see with the Bernie Sanders topic that political candidates start
gaining traction as early as June.

And people begin publishing polls around the same time. This momentum is
carried through to election time.

So it is important to start campaigning and guiding the conversation towards
favorable polls around June.

---

Finally we define the myopicity score for each publication which corresponds to
the fraction of articles dedicated to the single most dominant story.

At the bottom we see that People magazine focuses close to 75% of its politics
news articles on a single story. So it is heavily myopic and these myopic
outlets are ideal to start promoting/attacking candidates such as Bernie
Sanders and guiding the conversation around polls.
